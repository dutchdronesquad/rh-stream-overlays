# About

This plugin adds new designed stream overlays to RotorHazard, which can be used in OBS (Open Broadcaster Software). A showcase of all overlays can be [found here](./stream_overlays/).

Do you have any wishes for a new overlay? Then leave your ideas, sketches or mood board in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/dutchdronesquad/rh-stream-overlays/discussions) and maybe, we can develop it into something beautiful üòç
