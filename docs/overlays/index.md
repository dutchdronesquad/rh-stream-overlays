# Overview

The plugin offers the overlays in the form of "themes" that you can choose from. For each theme, you can see on a separate page which overlays are available and what they look like.

Links to the specific theme overlays:

- [Dutch Drone Squad](./dds.md)
- [Liga Colombiana Drone Racing](./lcdr.md)

!!! question "Ideas for new themes?"
    If you have ideas for a new overlay theme, you can always start a topic in the [discussions](https://github.com/dutchdronesquad/rh-stream-overlays/discussions) forum with some sketches or example images.

!!! tip "Did you know?"
    The stream overlays plugin also generates overlay URLs on the **Stream Displays** page in Rotorhazard, making it even easier to get the right URL for your overlay and use it in OBS ðŸ˜‰
