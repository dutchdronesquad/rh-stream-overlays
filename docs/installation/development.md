Are you not a coder? But would you like to share ideas for new features? Then join the [discussions] and we will work out some sketches together.

## Plugin code

1. **Fork** and **Clone** the repository to your local machine
2. Create a [symlink] from the `stream_overlays` folder to the RotorHazard `plugin` folder

ln -s ~/rh-stream-overlays/stream_overlays/ ~/RotorHazard/src/server/plugins/stream_overlays
```

3. Start or restart RotorHazard
4. You can now start developing ðŸ˜„
